# UR RTDE Program Cue Loop in Grasshopper
###### RTDE-based UR program cue looping in Grasshopper with Robots plugin. Features 2 workflows using runtime_state monitoring to upload programs sequentially: (1) 3D printing with large toolpath splitting and (2) milling with automated rail repositioning.

![Banner](Pictures/Banner.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains Grasshopper workflows for **sequential UR program execution using RTDE feedback**. Rather than sending one large program, toolpaths are split into multiple URPs that are **automatically queued and run** using `runtime_state` monitoring. The **Robots plugin** handles upload, while a **C# RTDE client** streams live data to Grasshopper for cueing and visualization.

Two example files are included:

* **3D Printing** — split toolpaths for large-format extrusion
* **Milling + Rail** — automated base shifting per program for multi-position milling

The repository also provides the **RTDE variable index list** and the **C# client scripts** required for real-time feedback.

**Plugins required:**

* **[Robots](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/robots)** _(by visose)_ — core plugin for generating UR programs and controlling robot motion.
* **[Heteroptera](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/heteroptera)** _(by Amin Bahrami)_ — for data flow control and triggers.
* **[Pufferfish](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/pufferfish)** _(by ekimroyrp)_ — miscellaneous components supporting workflow logic.

> Ensure all plugins are installed before opening the example definitions.

## Grasshopper Workflow

The Grasshopper setup establishes a **program cue loop** where multi-part robot jobs run in sequence without manual intervention. A long toolpath (for printing or milling) is first **split into multiple UR programs**, each representing one segment of the fabrication task. Splitting serves two purposes:

1. Keeping each program under the controller buffer limit (*[≈2500 targets when uploaded remotely through Robots](https://github.com/visose/Robots/discussions/112), up to ~80,000 when loaded via USB/FTP*).  
2. Enabling the workaround for **7th-axis rail movement**, where the toolpath is divided whenever a rail repositioning is required so each segment stays in reach of the robot. As mentioned in the Robots repository's discussion, [UR kinematics is not yet compatible with a 7th axis](https://github.com/visose/Robots/discussions/106#discussioncomment-1740335).

```
           Program Sequencer ⟶ Simulation
                   ↑
Toolpath ⟶ Split Programs ⟶ Trigger Queue ⟶ Remote Upload ⟶ RUN
                                     ↑
                                    RTDE ⟶ Real-time Preview
```

Program execution works through two parallel systems:

* **Robots Remote Interface** — uploads and runs each URP program  
* **RTDE Client (read-only)** — monitors robot status and detects when a program stops

When `runtime_state = Stopped`, the **Heteroptera "Oil Can" component** fires the trigger that uploads the next UR program in the queue, enabling continuous execution without operator input. A **Program Sequencer** branches out from the program list only for **preview/index visualization**, allowing simulation of the sequence before running it on the robot. The `actual_TCP_pose` from the RTDE client can be fed into the Robots **Kinematics** component for real-time inverse kinematics calculation and visualization in Rhino.

This makes it possible to toggle between **simulation and real execution using the same definition**.

0 = Stopping / Not Running
1 = Stopped
2 = Running / Playing
3 = Pausing
4 = Paused
5 = Resuming
```

</details>

This structure supports:

* **large-scale 3D printing** using segmented toolpaths
* **milling with rail repositioning**, where each segment recalculates the base to match the new rail position

In both workflows, the cue mechanism remains identical — only the geometry logic changes.

## Example 1 — Large Toolpath 3D Printing

📂 Grasshopper file:
[`UR_Printing_Cue_Loop.gh`](https://github.com/cxlso/UR_RTDE_ProgramCue_GH/raw/refs/heads/main/Grasshopper/UR_Printing_Cue_Loop.gh)

This example demonstrates splitting a long toolpath into smaller program chunks to avoid size limitations and improve reliability during large prints. Each segment is exported as a separate URP and executed in sequence using the cue loop described above.

> 🔁 When program N finishes, `runtime_state` = Stopped → next program uploads automatically.

Includes:

* toolpath segmentation slider
* program batching logic
* optional simulation playback
* remote control upload and monitoring

## Example 2 — Milling with Rail Repositioning

📂 Grasshopper file:
[`UR_Milling_Cue_Loop.gh`](https://github.com/cxlso/UR_RTDE_ProgramCue_GH/raw/refs/heads/main/Grasshopper/UR_Milling_Cue_Loop.gh)

This workflow demonstrates milling with a rail that is **not configured as a 7th axis** in Robots. Instead, each target group is processed as a separate program, and the **rail base position is recalculated per program**. The base value is sent to the Vention rail controller via a custom URCap init command, effectively simulating multi-axis capability.

> For each program:
> target group → find closest rail position → update base → upload → run → cue next.

Includes:

* automatic rail repositioning based on target group centroid
* independent URP programs per motion set
* same cue structure as printing workflow
* simulation + real execution toggle

## RTDE Client Script

This repository includes a **Grasshopper C# RTDE client** used only to **read live feedback** from a Universal Robot — *not to upload or run programs*. Program sending is handled through the standard **Robots plugin remote interface**, while this client runs in parallel to monitor machine state.

> **I am not the author of these scripts.**
> I found them online some time ago and cannot relocate the original source (please let me know if you find the source).
> I believe they were written by [**Visose**](https://github.com/visose), the creator of the Robots plugin.
> I only updated them to work inside the newer Grasshopper C# environment

The script exposes functions implemented in the Robots plugin [RTDE layer](https://github.com/visose/Robots/blob/master/src/Robots/Remotes/URRealTimeDataExchange.cs).

It connects to the robot, reads the `URRealTimeDataExchange` outputs, and makes them available to Grasshopper for tasks such as:

* tracking `runtime_state` to cue next program
* monitoring `script_control_line`
* providing real-time `actual_TCP_pose`

### DLL Linking Note

Since Rhino/Grasshopper 8 changed the C# component behavior, the script requires manual reference to the `Robots.dll` library.

Example path (adjust to your install):

```
C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\packages\8.0\Robots\1.9.0\Robots.dll
```

### Files Included

📂 [`URRTDE_Client.cs`](CSharp/URRTDE_Client.cs)
Reads RTDE outputs live and returns values + logs.

📂 [`URRTDE_Variables.cs`](CSharp/URRTDE_Variables.cs)
Lists all available RTDE variable names from the Robots plugin.
